#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
-Importance: Ensures reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-1950s: First high-level programming languages (e.g., FORTRAN).
-1970s: Introduction of the Waterfall model.
-2001: Agile Manifesto and the rise of Agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Gathering
Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
  Example:  large construction projects.
- Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
  Example: software apps.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs: Tools for coding, debugging, and testing e.g Visual Studio, IntelliJ.
-VCS: Tracks changes to code and enables collaboration e.g Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Designing prompts to interact effectively with AI models.
-Importance: Ensures better responses and accurate results from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."
-Improved Prompt: "Give me a brief history of the Roman Empire."
-Why: The improved prompt is specific, making it easier for the AI to provide a relevant answer.
